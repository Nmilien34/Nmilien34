 I'm Nick. I figure out what's worth building and erase the gap between deciding, prototyping, and shipping. I care about solving the right problems and obsess over well‑designed products, from software to hardware. I previously built a venture‑backed startup.

Welcome to my GitHub. I like building stuff and you can find couple of them here, some of them are vibe-coded and some built manually, If any of them peak your interest, shoot me an email.
In the past I've built:

Lawnstack[Lawnstack](https://www.lawnstack.com/) - A home membership platform for outdoor chores 
Boltzman Engine [Boltzman Engine](https://www.boltzman.ai/) - A universal AI assistant that helps you get things done faster 
Boltzman Voice [Boltzman Voice](https://voice.boltzman.ai/) - A universal voice AI assistant that brings your apps, tabs, and platforms to you
Boltzman Enterprise [Boltzman Enterprise](https://enterprise.boltzman.ai/) - Voice AI platform for SMBs; we built voice AI solutions for restaurants and salons
Energy [Energy(NRG)](https://www.yfhnrg.com/) - A YouTube wrapper to listen to ad-free music

I've also worked on a ton of other projects that are not located here and occasionally work as a contractor, building MVPs for small teams

I've built projects using C/C++, Python, and TypeScript/JavaScript, but I use TypeScript/JavaScript alot more than others. I also have built a ton of embedded systems projects, I work with Raspberry pi's, arduinos and op-amps
