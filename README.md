Senior Electrical & Computer Engineering student at NJIT with a passion for solving problems through entrepreneurship. I specialize in going from 0 to 1, creating both consumer and enterprise products at the intersection of hardware and software.

Currently building multimodal AI products for enterprises, with a focus on voice AI solutions for restaurants that generate revenue and deliver measurable impact.
