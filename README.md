## About

I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology with a focus on electronics, but my real passion has always been finding patterns in complex problems. I'm not naturally the fastest at logical thinking, but I have this thing for breaking down problems to their core and figure out what works, what doesn't, and why. I need time to really visualize concepts in my head, but once something clicks, I tend to get pretty good at it. That journey led me to fall in love with entrepreneurship. My brain is wired like a systems engineer, but I want those systems to actually matter. To me, products are just systems and logic that solve real problems for people who genuinely need the solution. I'll be honest, I still struggle with coming up with completely novel systems from scratch, but I have a knack for spotting inefficiencies and figuring out how to fix them. My goal is to live at the intersection of sales, product development, and technical execution. Whether that means coding, circuit design, or whatever else it takes to bring a system to life, I do what's needed to create solutions that have real impact. I'm drawn to the full spectrum, from understanding what people actually need, to building the system that delivers it, to getting it into their hands.

## What I'm Building

Over the past 8 months, I started a lab called Boltzman (named after [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ludwig-Boltzmann), where I‚Äôve been learning how to work with LLMs and sharpening my skills in building well-crafted software. In that time, I‚Äôve built 3 revenue-generating products.

 ‚Äî With my good friend [Liam Du](https://github.com/LiamDu386), a product engineer, we built a chatbot that helps users and researchers browse the internet faster without context switching. It‚Äôs similar to Perplexity, but with integrations into Google Docs, Notion, and Slack. We reached 3,000 users in 1 month and got 20 paying customers for the premium tier.

Boltzman Voice[Boltzman Voice](https://voice.boltzman.ai/)
 ‚Äî Next, we built an agentic voice assistant designed for downtime moments like driving, working out, or doing chores, when you still want to get things done but can‚Äôt access your devices. With Boltzman Voice, users could browse the internet and stay productive hands-free. It grew to 271 users with 1 paying subscriber.

 ‚Äî While building the earlier projects, I became really excited about voice agents and saw an opportunity in local businesses, restaurants, hotels, salons, etc. I solo-built a voice agent that answers calls, takes orders, books appointments, and answers customer questions. I partnered with Clover, Square, and OpenTable to integrate into their systems, and scaled the business to $28,125 MRR in 3 months with 70% margins. It still pays for itself‚Äîand my bills.

For the first two products, my focus was backend engineering, integrations, and testing. For the third, I took on a full-stack role (frontend + backend) while also handling sales, marketing, and customer support.

## Experience


**Before starting the Boltzman Lab, I began my entrepreneurial journey with a home services startup. We built a home services membership platform called [Lawnstack](https://www.lawnstack.com)
 for outdoor home maintenance. Essentially, we provided homeowners with a dedicated team of service providers who came every month to take care of all the outdoor chores that needed doing around the house. The startup generated $80K in GMV and was backed by [Alchemist Accelerator](https://alchemistaccelerator.com/) .I had the opportunity to work with a highly talented team, friends who were from  MIT, Cornell, Harvard, Georgia Tech, and UPenn‚Äîmany of whom now work at Meta, HRT, Stripe, and Palantir.

During my time at Lawnstack, I was CEO and led product development, which is where I cultivated most of my product thinking skills.

## Technical Skills

When it comes to coding, I started with ‚Äúmocking‚Äù languages like HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript when I was 17 in high school. Later, I got introduced to C during Embedded Systems 1, where I learned about memory manipulation and got a glimpse into low-level programming. I worked on many projects in C, but I struggled a lot. Trying to escape some of C‚Äôs frustrations, I discovered C++, which gave me more freedom. I enjoyed it so much that I took classes from the computer science curriculum focused on C++.

During Embedded Systems 2, I used Python to build projects. Python felt almost like magic because it read like English‚Äîthough I still wasn‚Äôt a fan of indentation, I ended up working with it a lot.

At the Boltzman Lab, my friend Liam introduced me to TypeScript. While I already knew the basics of JavaScript, TypeScript opened up a whole new world. For the past year, I‚Äôve been focused on mastering it, it‚Äôs the one language I truly want to excel in.

Coding without AI is getting harder these days. Back in the day, Stack Overflow was invaluable for learning syntax. With AI, I rely more on it, which sometimes makes me forget syntax but pushes me to focus more on architecture and system design. Using AI, I can now build almost any product, handling both frontend and backend, and take something from 0 to 1 in just a few hours.
